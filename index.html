      <h4>Information Design</h4>
      <div class="twoColumns">
        <div class="column">
          <p>
            Fractal Fantasy adopts a minimalist visual approach, prioritising
            clarity and user focus on audiovisual interaction. The interface is
            dominated by an ambient canvas that responds to mouse movement,
            while a compact control panel is positioned in the upper right
            corner. The panel features white text and purple sliders on a black
            background, creating strong visual contrast while drawing user
            attention. The control panel is vertically aligned, ensuring minimal
            intrusion on the main visual field. The limited colour palette –
            black, white, purple and various greys – reinforces cohesion and
            avoids distraction, aligning with the system’s purpose as an
            audiovisual synthesiser. The user is encouraged to explore the
            subtle changes without visual clutter, using proximity in the slider
            arrangement to suggest functional grouping. This visual restraint
            reflects the intention for deliberate, focused interaction.

          <p>
            In contrast, Limp Body Beat by Adult Swim uses a maximalist, surreal
            aesthetic to drive user interaction. The interface is saturated with
            pastel and fleshy tone, creating a textured, chaotic environment
            that mimics body parts in both form and colour. Instead of
            separating controls from the environment, interactive elements are
            embedded into the scene, some are visible in a grid, while others
            appear as a floating body part or buttons. Although the interface
            initially offers no textual guidance, this encourages a
            trial-and-error approach. The use of transparency in note blocks
            creates a slight visual hierarchy that helps navigation, though it’s
            not always intuitive. Unlike Fractal Fantasy’s reserved structure,
            Limp Body Beat thrives on sensory overload, with its abstract
            layering and textures designed to invoke curiosity and amusement
            rather than control and clarity.

      <h4>Mapping</h4>
      <div class="twoColumns">
        <div class="column">
          <p>
            The mapping in Fractal Fantasy is deliberate and precise. Each
            slider within the control panel adjusts a specific audiovisual
            parameter, and changes are reflected in real time on the canvas. The
            layout is clean and consistent, with white slider knobs that are
            easily distinguishable, accompanied by numerical feedback to
            indicate exact values. This one-to-one relationship between control
            and effect supports the interaction design principle of
            predictability. As users adjust variables like “zoom”, “lightness”
            or “entropy”, the visual field and accompanying audio shift
            accordingly. The transparency between input and output is core to
            the interface’s experimental function; it is less about discovery
            through randomness and more about intentional modulation through
            control.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <p>
            Limp Body Beat, by contrast, offers a much more physical and
            embodied mapping. While the beat-grid provides a consistent
            rhythm-based interface, sound can be manipulated by dragging and
            flinging a limp body into oncoming blocks. This introduces a layer
            of absurd physicality, where motion and timing directly influence
            audio output. Unlike Fractal Fantasy’s clearly labelled sliders, the
            controls here are less explicitly mapped, there are no labels or
            tooltips, but are instead designed to encourage exploration over
            precision. This supports the principle of learnability through play.
            The unpredictability of limb movements and their musical
            consequences reinforces the surreal tone, allowing chaotic
            experimentation rather than calculated control.

      <h4>Characterisation</h4>
      <div class="twoColumns">
        <div class="column">
          <p>
            Characterisation plays a key role in setting expectations and
            guiding interaction in both interfaces. In Fractal Fantasy, the
            aesthetic of high-definition textures, glowing and subtle metallic
            ripples suggests a synthetic, immersive environment. This abstract
            environment cues users to expect ambient, non-linear interaction
            rather than functional or goal-oriented tasks. The minimalist
            design, combined with technical terminology in the control panel,
            frames the interface as a too or instrument for creative
            exploration. The experience presents itself as audiovisual art, and
            its interface characterises normal interaction as quiet,
            experimental, and deliberate.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <p>
            In contrast, Limp Body Beat is immediately chaotic and surreal,
            evoking humour and absurdity through grotesque anatomy and pastel
            landscapes. The interface doesn’t resemble a traditional tool or app
            but instead a digital playable artwork. Users are thrown into an
            environment with minimal instruction, and the central figure – a
            limp, body part – suggests that this is not designed to be a serious
            system. Instead it characterises interaction as something to poke,
            drag and disrupt, with visual exaggeration reinforcing that
            unexpected results are normal. The aesthetic creates a context where
            unpredictability is expected and where formal feedback loops are
            secondary to playful discovery. The characterisation invites users
            to experiment and interpret the interface as fun sound instrument
            rather than a tool for precise creation.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h4>Feedback</h4>
      <div class="twoColumns">
        <div class="column">
          <p>
            Fractal Fantasy provides immediate but subtle feedback to user
            input. Upon entering the interface, mouse movements cause changes in
            lighting and reflections on the canvas, accompanied by shifts in
            ambient sound. Adjusting any of the sliders in the control panel
            results in visual or audio alterations that reflect the new
            parameter values, though some feedback are not as easily
            perceptible. This creates a refined feedback system, cause and
            effect. It reinforces the interface’s ambient character and supports
            an experience of deep, intentional immersion rather than
            overstimulation. The consistency of feedback aligns well with users
            who seek controlled experimentation.

            Limp Body Beat offers highly exaggerated and immediate feedback.
            Every beat that strikes the body triggers visual distortions and
            synchronised sound effects. The body flails, bends and reacts with
            comedic flair, making each action feel dynamic. Interacting with the
            beat-grid or changing tempo instantly affects the incoming note
            blocks, and the audio adjusts accordingly. This dramatic response
            supports visibility, as users can easily understand the results of
            their actions, encouraging repeat interaction due to the sense of
            fun and chaotic energy, rather than careful control.

        Both UIs offer unique interaction designs, while serving different
        purposes. Fractal Fantasy is more controlled and minimalistic, and Limp
        Body Beat is more experimentative and humourous with its
        unpredictability. These contrasting approaches illustrate how interface
        aesthetics and interaction design principles can shape both expectations
        and behaviours of users within digital experiences.
