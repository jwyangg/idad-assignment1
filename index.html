        Fractal Fantasy: Liquid Entropy Information Design: - Abstract
        information design - No visible navigation or text-based guidance - The
        interactive elements emerge as users begin to move their cursor, which
        is hinted by the shifting in light, motion and 3D depth - Visual
        hierarchy is defined through scale and motion - Proximity and white
        space - A canvas dedicated to the sensory experience - Control panel on
        the top right corner
      </p>
      <p>
        Mapping: - Control panel on the top right corner, consists of sliders to
        control the data - Consists of a checkbox and sliders, alongside a reset
        button - You are able to tell that it’s a slider because the horizontal
        layout of the slider with a contrasting colour for the slider button
        itself - However, the main way to “activate” the sound is intuitive and
        implicit. There are no separate buttons, sliders or labels. Rather the
        user moves the mouse around the page to explore what sections make what
        sounds. Moving the cursor around alters visual depth and spatial audio
